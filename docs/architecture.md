# AI-Powered Distributed Workflow Platform

This system orchestrates multi-step business workflows across microservices.

Example use case:
Food ordering (Zomato / Swiggy style)

Flow:
Order → Payment → Inventory → Restaurant → Delivery → Notification

The workflow engine controls execution, tracks state, handles failures, and retries.
Each microservice is independent.
